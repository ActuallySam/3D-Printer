After connecting the printer to the pronterface , just type the CODE :
                                                 M303 S215	C10

M303 - Will do the PID tuning of the thing
S215 -Will set the temperature of the extruder to 215 degrees
C10- Will make the thing do its thing till 10 cycles

Run that until it gives the 3 default values for the P, I and D separately.

Now enter :               M301 P(value) I(value) D(value)  

It probably will give the configuration output for that thing. Even if it doesn't , to save the code and the changes, 
Enter :                       M500

That's it folks.......................
